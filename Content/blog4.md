Hi Everyone,



Today, I want to discuss an advanced topic concerning PDF generation in applications and the critical vulnerabilities associated with it. You’re all familiar with this well-known common vulnerability, but I just wanted to share it with you.


Most of the web applications provide a PDF generation features, commonly used for invoices or reports, which often incorporate dynamic user input. In this we will discuss the misconfigurations and vulnerability that can lead to critical security vulnerabilities. It’s basically caused by HTML injection in the user input that is processed by PDF generation libraries.


Let's talk about PDF!


PDF — Portable Document Format is a widely used format designed for platform-independent document display. PDF files are widely used for many applications. Many web applications incorporate PDF generation capabilities, typically through external libraries or plugins.



However, vulnerabilities can arise due to misconfigurations, insufficient security settings, or outdated versions of these libraries, often allowing attackers to exploit unsanitized malicious input.



Here are a few PDF generation libraries commonly used in web applications:

- [TCPDF](https://tcpdf.org/)
- [html2pdf](https://github.com/spipu/html2pdf)
- [mPDF](https://mpdf.github.io/)
- [DomPDF](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf)
- [PDFKit](https://pdfkit.org/)
- [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)
- [PD4ML](https://pd4ml.com/)


Web applications often need to control the layout of generated PDF files, so these libraries take HTML as input and use it to produce the final PDF. This enables the application to manage the PDF’s design through CSS within the HTML. These libraries operate by parsing the HTML, rendering it, and then converting it into a PDF.


Example: TCPDF


TCPDF is a popular open-source PHP library used to generate PDF documents programmatically. It is known for its ability to convert HTML and CSS into a PDF file without requiring any external extensions. Below is an overview of how TCPDF works, followed by some example code to illustrate its usage


# How TCPDF Works:

- **Initialize the PDF Document:** TCPDF allows you to create a new PDF instance, where you can set properties like page size, margins, orientation, etc.
- **Adding Content:** You can add text, HTML, images, tables, and other elements to the PDF using different functions.
- **Rendering HTML to PDF:** TCPDF can take HTML and CSS code and render it as a styled PDF.
- **Output PDF:** Once all the content has been added, the library provides methods to save the PDF to a file, force a download, or display it directly in the browser.


Example Code:

Since TCPDF can take HTML as input to generate PDF files, if the application allows untrusted user input to be included in the HTML without proper sanitization, it can lead to HTMLInjection. Attackers could inject malicious HTML, which may result in xss and html injection.
